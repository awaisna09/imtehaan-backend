# 🔍 Troubleshooting: Topics Not Being Fetched

## 🚨 **Current Error:**
```
Error fetching topics: Error: No topics found for subject_id: 101
```

## 🎯 **Step-by-Step Diagnosis:**

### **Step 1: Check Your Database Data**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bgenvwieabtxwzapgeee
2. Click **SQL Editor**
3. Run the contents of `comprehensive_debug.sql`
4. **Share the results** - especially:
   - Does the table exist?
   - How many total rows?
   - What subject_ids do you have?
   - Are there any topics with subject_id = 101?

### **Step 2: Fix RLS (Most Likely Issue)**
1. In SQL Editor, run the contents of `fix_rls_public_access.sql`
2. This will allow public access to your topics table
3. Check if the test queries at the end return data

### **Step 3: Check Your Data Structure**
**Expected Results from Step 1:**
```
table_exists: true
total_rows: [some number > 0]
topics_for_101: [some number > 0]
```

**If you see:**
- `table_exists: false` → Table doesn't exist
- `total_rows: 0` → No data in table
- `topics_for_101: 0` → No topics for Business Studies

### **Step 4: Verify Your Subject IDs**
The code expects:
- Business Studies = `subject_id = 101`
- Mathematics = `subject_id = 102`
- Physics = `subject_id = 103`
- Chemistry = `subject_id = 104`

**Check what subject_ids you actually have:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT subject_id FROM topics ORDER BY subject_id;
```

## 🔧 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue 1: RLS Blocking Access**
**Symptoms:** Table exists, has data, but queries return empty
**Solution:** Run `fix_rls_public_access.sql`

### **Issue 2: Wrong Subject ID**
**Symptoms:** No topics found for subject_id 101
**Solution:** Check what subject_ids you actually have and update the mapping

### **Issue 3: No Data**
**Symptoms:** Total rows = 0
**Solution:** You need to add data to your topics table

### **Issue 4: Wrong Column Names**
**Symptoms:** Column errors
**Solution:** Verify your table structure matches expected columns

## 📋 **Quick Tests:**

### **Test 1: Direct Database Query**
```sql
SELECT * FROM topics WHERE subject_id = 101;
```

### **Test 2: Check All Data**
```sql
SELECT * FROM topics LIMIT 5;
```

### **Test 3: Check Subject IDs**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT subject_id, COUNT(*) FROM topics GROUP BY subject_id;
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Run `comprehensive_debug.sql`** and share results
2. **Run `fix_rls_public_access.sql`** to fix RLS
3. **Test the practice page** again
4. **Check browser console** for new debug messages

## 📊 **Expected Console Output After Fix:**

**Success:**
```
=== TOPICS DEBUG START ===
Fetching topics for subject: businessStudies
Using subject_id: 101
Database query result: { data: [{ topic: "Marketing" }, { topic: "Finance" }, ...], error: null }
Transformed data: [{ id: "1", title: "Marketing", ... }, ...]
=== TOPICS DEBUG END ===
```

**Still Error:**
```
=== TOPICS ERROR ===
Error fetching topics: Error: No topics found for subject_id: 101
Using fallback topics for Business Studies
```

## 🚀 **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Share the results** of `comprehensive_debug.sql`
2. **Check if you have data** for subject_id 101
3. **Verify your subject_id mapping** matches your actual data
4. **The app will work** with fallback topics even if database fails

**Run the debug script and share the results so we can identify the exact issue!**
