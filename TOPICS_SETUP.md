# Topics Table Setup Guide

## Current Issue
You're getting a 400 error when trying to fetch topics from the database. This is because the topics table needs to be created in Supabase.

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Run the Updated Schema
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/bgenvwieabtxwzapgeee
2. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Copy and paste the **entire** contents of `supabase/schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the schema

### Step 2: Verify Topics Table Creation
1. Go to **Table Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Check if you see a `topics` table
3. Click on the `topics` table to see the data

### Step 3: Check Sample Data
The schema includes sample Business Studies topics:
- Marketing
- Finance  
- Operations Management
- Human Resources
- Entrepreneurship
- Business Environment
- Business Strategy
- Business Ethics

## What the Schema Creates

### ✅ **Topics Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE topics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  difficulty TEXT,
  order_index INTEGER,
  is_active BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### ✅ **RLS Policies:**
- Topics are viewable by all authenticated users
- No write access needed for now

### ✅ **Sample Data:**
- 8 Business Studies topics with descriptions
- Proper difficulty levels and ordering

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run the schema** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Go to Practice page** in your app
3. **Click on Business Studies** 
4. **Check browser console** for success messages
5. **Topics should load** from the database

## Fallback System

If the database fails, the app will automatically use hardcoded topics:
- Marketing
- Finance
- Operations Management
- Human Resources
- Entrepreneurship

## Browser Console Messages to Look For

```
✅ "Fetching topics for subject: businessStudies"
✅ "Topics fetched successfully: [array of topics]"
```

## If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Table Editor** - Verify topics table exists
2. **Check RLS Policies** - Make sure topics table has proper policies
3. **Check Sample Data** - Verify topics are inserted
4. **Use Fallback** - App will work with hardcoded topics

## Next Steps

1. **Run the schema** in Supabase
2. **Test the practice page**
3. **Add more topics** as needed
4. **Customize topic descriptions** and difficulty levels

The practice page will work perfectly once the topics table is set up!
