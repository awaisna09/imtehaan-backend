## üì± Usage Examples

### Tracking Platform Activities
```typescript
import { comprehensiveAnalyticsService } from './utils/supabase/comprehensive-analytics-service';

// Track dashboard visit
await comprehensiveAnalyticsService.trackPlatformActivity(
  userId,
  'dashboard_visit',
  0,
  'Dashboard',
  'General'
);

// Track topic selection
await comprehensiveAnalyticsService.trackPlatformActivity(
  userId,
  'topic_selection',
  topicId,
  topicName,
  subjectName
);

// Track AI tutor interaction
await comprehensiveAnalyticsService.trackPlatformActivity(
  userId,
  'ai_tutor',
  topicId,
  topicName,
  subjectName
);
```

### Getting Real-Time Analytics
```typescript
// Get comprehensive analytics
const analytics = await comprehensiveAnalyticsService.getRealTimeAnalytics(userId);

// Access today's progress
const today = analytics.today;
console.log(`Activities today: ${today.totalActivities}`);
console.log(`Study time: ${today.studyTimeMinutes} minutes`);
console.log(`Accuracy: ${today.dailyAccuracy}%`);

// Access weekly trends
const weekly = analytics.thisWeek;
console.log(`Weekly activities: ${weekly.totalActivities}`);
console.log(`Most productive day: ${weekly.mostProductiveDay}`);

// Access monthly insights
const monthly = analytics.thisMonth;
console.log(`Monthly improvement: ${monthly.improvementRate}%`);
console.log(`Longest streak: ${monthly.longestStreak} days`);
```

## üîß Configuration

### Daily Reset Timing
The system automatically resets at midnight. To customize:
```typescript
// In enhanced-analytics-tracker.ts
enhancedAnalyticsTracker.initializeDailyReset();
```

### Cache Duration
Analytics data is cached for 5 minutes by default:
```typescript
// In comprehensive-analytics-service.ts
private readonly CACHE_DURATION = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
```

### Activity Types
Supported activity types for tracking:
```typescript
type ActivityType = 
  | 'question' 
  | 'flashcard' 
  | 'lesson' 
  | 'video_lesson' 
  | 'mock_exam' 
  | 'practice_session' 
  | 'ai_tutor' 
  | 'dashboard_visit' 
  | 'topic_selection' 
  | 'settings_change'
